**PROBLEM STATEMENT: The Doomed Dice Problem**

Given two six-sided dice named Die A and Die B, each with faces numbered from 1 to 6.
The dice are rolled simultaneously and have to find the total combinations possible, distribution of all possible combinations and probability of all possible sums occuring.

**PART-A**

1. The formula for finding the total possible combinations is the No. of faces of the object power No. of objects.

   In this case, the object given is Dice.

   Number of faces of the dice = 6

   Number of dice rolled = 2

   Thus, 6^2 = 36 total combinations.
