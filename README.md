# **PROBLEM STATEMENT: The Doomed Dice Problem**

Given two six-sided dice named Die A and Die B, each with faces numbered from 1 to 6.
The dice are rolled simultaneously and have to find the total combinations possible, distribution of all possible combinations and probability of all possible sums occuring.

## **PART-A**

### **1.** **TOTAL POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS:**
   
   * The formula for finding the total possible combinations is the No. of faces of the object power No. of objects.

   * In this case, the object given is Dice.

   Number of faces of the dice = 6

   Number of dice rolled = 2

   Thus, 6^2 = 36 total combinations.

### **2.** **DISTRIBUTION OF ALL POSSIBLE COMBINAITONS:**

   * To print the distribution of all possible combinations, 2 for loops are executed.

   * The first for loop iterates through the first dice values and second for loop iterates through the second dice values.

   * The combinations are printed in the format of 6x6 matrix.

   * The first element of the dice1 is combined with all the values of dice2 and second element of dice1 is combined with all the values of dice2 and the process goes on untill the last element of the dice1 is combined with last element of the dice2.
